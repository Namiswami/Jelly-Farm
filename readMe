Jelly Farm

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
The application is a fun project designed to show off some skills. It is made up out of 2 microservices, and uses a Postgres DB and Kafka message broker.
The fastest way to get the application running is to use the docker-compose file, found in the jelly-farm-resources project folder, in the docker directory.
Just navigate to this directory and type the magic words:

$ docker-compose up -d

Docker will download the images needed from dockerhub, and boot up the applications.
Everything should be working out-of-the-box.

Give the app a minute or so to boot, and you can then use the postman collection in the jelly-farm-resources/documentation to start using the app!

SOME BACKGROUND
Jellies are little creatures that hop around the world. They have a color and can be male or female, but otherwise have no special properties. Except their flavour of course!
This application simulates a 'jelly farm'.
It can be used to manage your own jelly farm, and comes with a jelly breeding extension that let's jellies reproduce.
Jellies live in cages and reproduce only with those in the same cage. A male jelly can only mate with a female jelly, but this is probably no surprise.
The reproduction timer is currently set to 30 seconds, meaning every 30 seconds, all male jellies will look for a mate and produce a new jelly into the farm if succesful!

IDEAS FOR FUTURE
- Adding push notifications or something of the sort to give active updates on breeding events (hence the message driven architecture)
- Building a GUI for the application
- Adding more properties to cages, such as climate
- Protect jellies from their inborn incestuous tendencies :S by adding a lineage system
- And much more!

Please ask the developer any question you'd like! It's a showcase project, but it's not perfect. There are still some todos and optimizations to be made.
